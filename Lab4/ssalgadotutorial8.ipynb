    "In the last chapter we discussed random variables and random distributions. Now we are going to use the distributions we learned to test our hypothesis and also to model the financial data. When building a trading strategy, it's essential to do some research. However, you won't be able to test your idea using all the data, because it's infinity. You can only use a sample to do your experiment. That's why we need to understand the difference between population and sample, and then use confidence interval to test our hypothesis.\n",
